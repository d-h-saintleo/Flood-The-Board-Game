# Game Instructions:
* The objective of the game is to flood the entire board with the same color in a limited amount of turns based on the size and complexity of the board. In order to do this, you must switch the color of the flood to a color of the neighboring tiles that are touching the flood until all tiles are the same color.

* **Terminal**: To get started, you first must select the width and heighth of the board as well as the number of colors to be used. Then you must select a color in order to switch the color of the flood. The board will update and display your current progress as you switch colors until the board is completely flood, or you exit the game.

* **GUI**: To get started, you first must select the width and heighth of the board as well as the number of colors to be used. Then you must click on any tile in order to switch the color of the flood to that tile's color. The board will update and display your current progress as you switch colors until the board is completely flood, or you exit the game.
